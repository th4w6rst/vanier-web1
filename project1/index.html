      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sharjana but most people call me sanji, and
        I've grown to love that nickname myself, so call me sanji :) I
        decided to join Multimedia because I consider myself to be somewhat
        of a creative person and once I saw what the program had to offer I
        couldn't resist.</p>
        <p> Overall I'm just hoping that I reach new heights with the knowledge
          that I'll gain in Multimedia and truly become the creative innovator
          I wish to be!
        </p></p>
      <p>I hope you guys have fun reading these tidbits about myself :)</p>

            <p>
              God do I love music, all different types of genres. From goth to
              pop, to country to jazz, I love them all. (Except EDM, EDM can
              rot.) ANYWAYS, I have a lot of favourite songs, but favourite
              artists? Only a handful. As seen on the picture, I.Love.Polyphia.
              I also love many other artists, such as Deftones,The Paper Kites,
              Noah Kahan, Playboi Carti,Baby Keem, Keshi and more!

              Honestly, I don't even think I'd even be so fond of music or
              confident in my abilities if it wasn't for the people around me.
              My family, friends and mentors are the reason I am who I am today
              and I could not be more grateful. All of you losers are truly the
              best things that have ever happened to me.
